# Weather-App
My code for my weather app

My weather app is an innovative tool that leverages geolocation to provide localized weather forecasts with the
utmost accuracy. 
It incorporates data structures like loops, functions, arrays and conditional statements to enhance
its functionality. 
With its maps feature, users can also explore current weather conditions from around the world.
As the sole developer, I prioritized quality and precision in every aspect of the app.
